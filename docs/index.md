# Welcome

Welcome to the Cypress Testing Handbook! This is a guide for testing Vue components using Cypress Component Testing. It's similar to the [Vue Testing Handbook](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/v3/), which I also wrote.

Cypress uses Vue Test Utils internally, so many of the ideas and concepts are directly appliable. This guide focues on the unique and more powerful features of Cypress, that allow you to write more robust, production-like tests.

It's still a work in progress. The goal is to include recipes for anything and everything, including integrating and testing third party libraries such as Vuetify, Vuelidate, etc - something that was painful and difficult with Vue Test Utils.

Ideas and suggestions for content are welcome - [file an issue here](https://github.com/lmiller1990/cypress-testing-handbook/issues).
